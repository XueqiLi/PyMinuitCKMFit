# PyMinuitCKMFit
A Simple Script for Fitting Flavor Observables Using [iMinuit](https://iminuit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Example
- See `fit_FlavorGW.ipynb` for a fitting of all sectors in traditional flavor model.
- See `fit_NearCritical.ipynb` for a fitting of the lepton sector in modular flavor model.
